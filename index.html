      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="http://zurihac.info/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors, or</li>
      <li>paying a membership fee of 50 CHF (students 25 CHF).</li>
    </ol>

And good docs make a huge difference to usability - all of us have struggled to use something because of poor documentation(2). In particular, docs for Haskell libraries have a reputation for being pretty opaque.</p> <p>So we know that documentation is important. But writing it is kind of a pain. And so many developers don't really bother.</p> <p>The goal of this talk is to make it much less painful for you to write documentation - and possibly even enjoyable. I'll give you a practical guide to writing effective documentation, and the conceptual background you need to understand the problem space.</p> <p>We'll cover:<br/>what to write, and how to work out what you need to write<br/>tips for making your writing clear and easy-to-read<br/>making docs work for your audience (aka - when it is and isn't appropriate to talk about category theory)<br/>how to put docs together in the Haskell ecosystem, and what should go where<br/>maintenance and testing<br/>with plenty of examples of good and bad along the way.</p> <p>(1) <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-ways-developers-learn-on-their-own" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-ways-developers-learn-on-their-own</a>, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-ways-developers-teach-themselves" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-ways-developers-teach-themselves</a><br/>(2) <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work</a></p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/250661375/">GHC Newcomers Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/249734259/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/248510184/">Nicolas Mattia - Interactive data exploration using Jupyter, Haskell and Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/247340310/">Getting things done in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/246552004/">BYOCP Nr. 1 - Bring Your Own Coding Problem</a></li></ul></div></div>

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.info">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

<p>
  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  contains all our Haskell-related videos.

<p>
  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
