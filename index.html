      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="http://zurihac.info/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="color: #666666">
      Occasionally, we reach out to our members with volunteering opportunities. Also, once a year we would send you an email to confirm and update the membership.

While the board and further volunteers did a fantastic job in 2019 to keep these events alive and well, the board also realizes that we may be short on volunteers to keep these events alive going forward. We therefore invite all interested parties to join this GA to determine what outcomes we would like to achieve in the next five years, what we can achieve, and how we plan to go about achieving these outcomes.</p> <p>To put it more bluntly: we have to honestly answer the question "who is willing to contribute what work to keep the momentum we have with ZuriHac and HaskellerZ going strong?"</p> <p>The official agenda is as follows:</p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2019.<br/>2. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for[masked].<br/>3. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2019.<br/>4. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2019.<br/>5. We elect the board for 2020.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there :)</p> <p>Note that members of the ZFoH have received an invitation via e-mail separately. It would nevertheless be good to RSVP to this event so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending.

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.info">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  contains all our Haskell-related videos.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
