      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="http://zurihac.info/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:

      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors, or</li>

Would you like to help the Zurich Haskell community grow?</p> <p>The General Assembly gives you the ability to get a glimpse into the Zurich Friends of Haskell and its roles. It is not a big event, but an important one. The agenda follows the statutes of the association: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8eHAK40hiH5jv79AscWtf3pyUNxx4Ls1LwkpLYK--8/edit" class="linkified">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8eHAK40hiH5jv79AscWtf3pyUNxx4Ls1LwkpLYK--8/edit</a></p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2018.<br/>2. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2019.<br/>3. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2018.<br/>4. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2018.<br/>5. We elect the board for 2019.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there :)</p> <p>Note there will be a HaskellerZ talk following the GA. That talk will be announced separately. This meetup is for the GA only.</p> <p>Note also members of the ZFoH have received an invitation via e-mail separately. It would nevertheless be good to RSVP to this event so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending.

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.info">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

<p>
  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  contains all our Haskell-related videos.

<p>
  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
