  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Friday 14 June to Sunday 16 June</strong>, the
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell association</a>
    will organize ZuriHac 2019, a three day
    <a href="https://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    Hackathon hosted at the
    <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/">HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    This is the eighth Haskell Hackathon organized in Zürich and and the third
    one hosted at the HSR. This fantastic venue is located right at lake Zürich
    and provides space for more than 400 participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Haskell Hackathon is a free, international, grassroots collaborative
    coding festival whose goal is to expand the community and to build and
    improve Haskell libraries, tools, and infrastructure.  This is a great
    opportunity to learn more about Haskell, meet fellow Haskellers in real
    life, find new contributors for your project, improve existing libraries and
    tools or even start new ones!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tickets are completely free.</strong>
    This event is open to any experience level, from beginners to gurus. In
    fact, one of the goals is to bring beginners in contact with experts so that
    the former can get a quick start in the Haskell community.
    We will have a dedicated beginners' course, and there will be mentors on
    site whom you can directly approach during the whole event with any
    Haskell-related question you have.

  <div class="anchor" id="how-it-works"></div>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    projects together.  At the start of the Hackathon maintainers get a few
    moments to present their project.  If you want, you can join any of these
    projects and learn, contribute code, write documentation, or make any other
    sort of progress.  There will be something for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will highlight a few projects on our website before the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course — in between hacking —  we love learning from some of the most
    interesting Haskellers out there, so we have a couple of
    <a href="#speakers">keynotes from several amazing people</a>
    from both industry and academia.

    In addition to that, there are some free
    <a href="#beginner-course">courses you can</a>
    <a href="#advanced-course">take as well</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please <a href="#contact">contact</a> us if you have more questions about
    the schedule.

  <h2>Beginner Info</h2>
  <p>
    We want to make the event accessible to Haskellers at all levels.  This is
    why we have dedicated mentors and beginner-level Haskell exercises every
    year, and 2019 will be the second year to feature an introductory course
    by Julie Moronuki.
  </p>

  <h3>Mentors</h3>
  <p>
    You can identify mentors from the black Zurihac shirt.  They welcome any
    questions you may have, so please grab them if you have any issues or
    questions.
  </p>

    <strong>Important update:</strong> unfortunately, Julie will not be able to
    make it to ZuriHac this year.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/panicwhenever">Ryan Moore</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course in her absence.

    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a>,
    the co-author of both
    <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from first principles</a>
    and
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">The Joy of Haskell</a>,
    has kindly agreed to teach a <em>free beginners course</em> for people who
    are just getting started with Haskell.  This beginner track will run on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon and will not conflict with any keynotes.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-course"></div>
  <h2>Advanced course</h2>
  <p>
    Due to popular demand we are offering an advanced track for the first time.
    So if you already feel comfortable with the basics of Haskell, but are eager
    to learn more, then you will be able to register as soon as we publish the
    programme.
    This course will be lead by the Haskell experts from
    <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>.

  <h1>Venue</h1>
  <p>
    The hackathon takes place at the
    <a href='https://www.hsr.ch/en'>HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    The
    <a href='https://www.google.ch/maps/place/HSR+Hochschule+f%C3%BCr+Technik+Rapperswil/@47.2233188,8.8150867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479ab6e12facc7ad:0x711fa65bf58f9c0f!8m2!3d47.2233188!4d8.8172754?hl=en'>campus</a>
    is about 40 minutes outside of the Zurich city.
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/zurihac2019/campus.jpg" alt="HSR campus"

  </div>

  <p>
    HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil<br/>
    Oberseestrasse 10<br/>
    8640 Rapperswil-Jona
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hackathon mainly takes place in two buildings: Building 1 and
    Building 4.  Detailed info on the different rooms will be announced later.
  </p>
  <p>
    The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
    (25°C, 77℉) during the previous years, so feel free to bring your swimming
    gear!
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>
  <p>
    You can take the S7 or S15 to get from the Zurich main station to
    Rapperswil.  These trains run regularly in 30 minute and 60 minute
    intervals, respectively.  Google maps works well for directions if you use
    the "public transport" tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you arrive at the Zurich airport, first take the train to the Zurich main
    station and then continue with S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
    the city run every few minutes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <p>
    As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay in Zurich,
    or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and disadvantages: there are
    more things to do in Zurich, but you can save time and transportation costs
    by staying in Rapperswil.
  </p>

  <p>
    During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
    <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
    fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
    in our <a href="https://slack.zurihac.info">Slack chat</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
    option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
    have stayed at
    <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
    in 2017 and 2018.
  </p>

  <h2 id="train-tickets">Train tickets</h2>

  <p>
    If you stay in Zurich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass for
    <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation around
    Zurich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24 hour pass
    34.40CHF.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can be
    used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
    Hackathon at e.g. 9.00, you can still use it to take the train at 8.00 the
    next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets for the three-day
    conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
    <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
    which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
    take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 on Friday, as described on the
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
    button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

    Alternatively, you can use the

  <h1>Registration</h1>
  <p>
    The Hackathon is completely free but the number of participants is limited
    to 450 people.  To this end, it is very important to us that you timely
    cancel your registration in case you cannot attend.  Around two months
    before the Hackathon, we will ask you to <em>confirm</em> your registration
    and after that you will be able to access your ticket.
  </p>
  <a class="action" href="https://zureg.zfoh.ch/register">To the registration</a>
  <p>
    Once we reach maximum capacity you will be queued into a wait list.  In case
    that somebody cancels we will fill up the seats from the wait list in first
    come first serve order and let you know.  Please do not book anything before
    we have confirmed a seat for you in a confirmation email.
  </p>

  <h2>Scholarships</h2>
  <p>
    Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac is a
    free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage somebody
    without a good income from attending.  We want to make it easier for anyone
    to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell community exciting and
    diverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships this year.
    Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget is limited and you
    can consider this year a "trial run" of the program. Anybody accepted will
    be supported with an amount between 100.- and 500.- Swiss Francs, depending
    on your expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
    groups in tech -- the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
    colour, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can apply by sending an email to
    <a href="mailto:scholarships@zfoh.ch">scholarships@zfoh.ch</a>, and include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A breakdown of your cost estimates (flight, train tickets,
      hotel/hostel/airbnb, food...).
    </li>
    <li>
      Why are you interested in functional programming?  Don't write an essay:
      one or two sentences should be enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      What makes you eligible?  Again, keep this brief, and please only
      share what you are comfortable with.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
    protect their privacy.  The amount you estimate for your expenses will not
    be a factor when we consider your application.  If necessary, we can
    transfer the money to you before you buy your plane/train ticket, so that
    you don't have to pay upfront if you are cash-strapped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a difference
    to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never disclose your
    identity.
