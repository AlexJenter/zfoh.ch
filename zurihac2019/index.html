  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Middle of June 2019, the
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell association</a>
    will organize ZuriHac 2019, a three day
    <a href="https://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    Hackathon hosted at the
    <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/">HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    This is the eighth Haskell Hackathon organized in Zürich and and the third
    one hosted at the HSR. This fantastic venue is located right at lake Zürich
    and provides space for more than 400 participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Haskell Hackathon is a <strong>completely free</strong>, international,
    grassroots collaborative coding festival whose goal is to expand the
    community and to build and improve Haskell libraries, tools, and
    infrastructure.  This is a great opportunity to learn more about Haskell,
    meet fellow Haskellers in real life, find new contributors for your project,
    improve existing libraries and tools or even start new ones!
  </p>
  <p>
    This event is open to any experience level, from beginners to gurus. In
    fact, one of the goals is to bring beginners in contact with experts so that
    the former can get a quick start in the Haskell community.
    We will have a dedicated beginners' course, and there will be mentors on
    site whom you can directly approach during the whole event with any
    Haskell-related question you have.

  <h2>Beginner Info</h2>
  <p>
    We want to make the event accessible to Haskellers at all levels.  This is
    why we have dedicated mentors and beginner-level Haskell exercises every
    year, and 2019 will be the second year to feature an introductory course
    by Julie Moronuki.
  </p>

  <h3>Mentors</h3>
  <p>
    You can identify mentors from the black Zurihac shirt.  They welcome any
    questions you may have, so please grab them if you have any issues or
    questions.
  </p>

  <h3>Beginner course</h3>

    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a>,
    the co-author of both
    <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from first principles</a>
    and
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">The Joy of Haskell</a>,
    has kindly agreed to teach a <em>free beginners course</em> for people who
    are just getting started with Haskell.  This beginner track will run on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon and will not conflict with any keynotes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In case you are interested in the beginners track, we will ask you to fill
    in a poll so we have a better idea of how many people will attend the track
    and what the level of the audience is.

  <h1>Venue</h1>
  <p>
    The hackathon takes place at the
    <a href='https://www.hsr.ch/en'>HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    The
    <a href='https://www.google.ch/maps/place/HSR+Hochschule+f%C3%BCr+Technik+Rapperswil/@47.2233188,8.8150867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479ab6e12facc7ad:0x711fa65bf58f9c0f!8m2!3d47.2233188!4d8.8172754?hl=en'>campus</a>
    is about 40 minutes outside of the Zurich city.
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/zurihac2019/campus.jpg" alt="HSR campus"
        style="max-width: 700px; width: 90%">
  </div>

  <p>
    HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil<br/>
    Oberseestrasse 10<br/>
    8640 Rapperswil-Jona
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hackathon mainly takes place in two buildings: Building 1 and
    Building 4.  Detailed info on the different rooms will be announced later.
  </p>
  <p>
    The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
    (25°C, 77℉) during the previous years, so feel free to bring your swimming
    gear!
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>
  <p>
    You can take the S7 or S15 to get from the Zurich main station to
    Rapperswil.  These trains run regularly in 30 minute and 60 minute
    intervals, respectively.  Google maps works well for directions if you use
    the "public transport" tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you arrive at the Zurich airport, first take the train to the Zurich main
    station and then continue with S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
    the city run every few minutes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <p>
    As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay in Zurich,
    or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and disadvantages: there are
    more things to do in Zurich, but you can save time and transportation costs
    by staying in Rapperswil.
  </p>

  <p>
    During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
    <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
    fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
    in our <a href="https://slack.zurihac.info">Slack chat</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
    option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
    have stayed at
    <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
    in 2017 and 2018.
  </p>

  <h2 id="train-tickets">Train tickets</h2>

  <p>
    If you stay in Zurich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass for
    <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation around
    Zurich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24 hour pass
    34.40CHF.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can be
    used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
    Hackathon at e.g. 9.00, you can still use it to take the train at 8.00 the
    next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets for the three-day
    conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
    <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
    which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
    take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 on Friday, as described on the
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
    button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

    Alternatively, you can use the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/service/apps/ticket-app.html">ZVV ticket app</a>
    on
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mnc.android.zvvticket">Android</a>
    or
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/zvv-tickets/id1033896474?mt=8">iOS</a>.
