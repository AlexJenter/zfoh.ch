    The Haskell Hackathon is a free, international, grassroots collaborative
    coding festival whose goal is to expand the community and to build and
    improve Haskell libraries, tools, and infrastructure.  This is a great
    opportunity to learn more about Haskell, meet fellow Haskellers in real
    life, find new contributors for your project, improve existing libraries and
    tools or even start new ones!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tickets are completely free.</strong>
    This event is open to any experience level, from beginners to gurus. In
    fact, one of the goals is to bring beginners in contact with experts so that
    the former can get a quick start in the Haskell community.
    We will have a dedicated beginners' course, and there will be mentors on
    site whom you can directly approach during the whole event with any
    Haskell-related question you have.
