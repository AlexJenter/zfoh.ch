  <h2>Update about COVID-19</h2>
  <p>
    The safety and well-being of our participants is very important to us.
    In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that it won't
    be possible to organize ZuriHac as originally planned.  Predicting how
    the situation will evolve in the next months is very difficult, making
    it tricky to even change the date for a physical event.  This makes it
    hard for us to proceed with the 2020 organization and build the great
    event that the Haskell community deserves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of canceling, we will organize ZuriHac 2020 as an online
    event.  We are still working out the details, and will update our
    website and send out announcements once we know more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to take the "community spirit" of ZuriHac online.  What
    can you expect at the very least?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Talks and courses over live streaming</li>
    <li>Working on projects together</li>
    <li>Hanging out with groups of other Haskellers in voice/video chat</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If anyone has experience running large online events, feel free to
    <a href="#contact">reach out</a> to us.
