  <h2>ZuriHac 2020 - Online Edition</h2>
  <strong>Friday 12 June — Sunday 14 June</strong>
  <p>
    Hi Haskell friends!
  </p>
  <p>
    So holding an event for 500 people in a physical location is clearly
    not an option this year. Instead, we are happy to inform you that the hackathon
    will take place as an <strong>online event</strong>. Read on below for the details, we're
    very eager to tell you how we intend to make it into a great event.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any comments or questions, just reach out to the orgnisers, you will
    find out <a dref="/zurihac2020#contact">contact information</a> below.
  </p>

  <p class="question">What is ZuriHac?</p>
  <p class="answer">
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> Hackathon
    in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival organized by
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
    It features fantastic keynotes, interesting tracks, and of course lots of
    hacking and socializing!
  </p>

  <p class="question">What will the online version look like?</p>
  <p class="answer">
    For the talks, we are streaming them live on YouTube. We will even hold the usual
    Q&A at the end, where our friendly moderators will pass your questions from
    the chat to the speaker.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    For the general hacking and socializing, we will be using
    <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>. It provides both chat channels like Slack and IRC,
    as well as voice channels with optional video/screen sharing. This gives us an
    online space where we can
    <ul>
      <li>collaborate & hack</li>
      <li>provide classes and tracks</li>
      <li>hold lightning talks</li>
      <li>casually talk to each other and exchange ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="question">How do I attend?</p>
  <p class="answer">
    I'm glad you asked!

    You still need to <a href="/zurihac2020/#registration">register</a>, so that we can provide
    a good experience to everybody. If you're privacy minded, feel free to choose any username
    you want.
