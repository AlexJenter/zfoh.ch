  <h2>Update about COVID-19</h2>
  <p>
    The safety and well-being of our participants is very important to us.
    In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that it won't
    be possible to organize ZuriHac as originally planned.  Predicting how
    the situation will evolve in the next months is very difficult, making
    it tricky to even change the date for a physical event.  This makes it
    hard for us to proceed with the 2020 organization and build the great
    event that the Haskell community deserves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of canceling, we will organize ZuriHac 2020 as an online
    event.  We are still working out the details, and will update our
    website and send out announcements once we know more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to take the "community spirit" of ZuriHac online.  What
    can you expect at the very least?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Talks and courses over live streaming</li>
    <li>Working on projects together</li>
    <li>Hanging out with groups of other Haskellers in voice/video chat</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If anyone has experience running large online events, feel free to
    <a href="#contact">reach out</a> to us.

  <h2>ZuriHac 2020 - Online Edition</h2>
  <p>
    Hi Haskell friends!
  </p>
  <p>
    So holding an event for 500 people in a physical location is clearly
    not an option this year. However, we are happy to have the hackathon in an online
    version instead, and we're very eager to provide you with a lot of the things that
    make ZuriHac a great time for everybody involved.
  </p>
  <p>
    What will this look like?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We are streaming the talks live on YouTube. We will even hold the usual
      Q&A at the end, where our friendly moderators will pass your questions from
      the chat to the speaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will use Discord as a digital space where we can collaborate, hack, hold lightning talks,
      or simply have a good time chatting with each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      You still need to <a href="/zurihac2020/#registration">register</a>, so that we provide
      a good experience to everybody. If you're privacy minded, feel free to choose any username
      on Discord you want, we don't insist on your real name.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After you register, you will find an invite link to our Discord server on your registration
    page. Please ignore our previous invite to the ZuriHac Slack, we won't be using it this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure you also head over to out <a href="/zurihac2020/projects.html">projects page</a>,
    and have a look at what interests you.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's it! We are of course doing this for the first time, and for all its downsides
    we are actually pretty excited about some additional possibilities that a remote event unlocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any comments or questions, just reach out to the orgnisers, you will
    find out <a dref="/zurihac2020#contact">contact information</a> below.
