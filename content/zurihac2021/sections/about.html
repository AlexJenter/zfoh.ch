    <p>
      There is still a lot of uncertainty around the COVID19 pandemic.
      However, we are committed to ensuring ZuriHac also happens in 2021.
      Depending on how the situation evolves, it may be organized as a physical
      event at
      <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/rapperswil-campus/">the
      OST (formerly HSR) campus in Rapperswil</a>, a virtual event, or a hybrid
      combination of the two.
