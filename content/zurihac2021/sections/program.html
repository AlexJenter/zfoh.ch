  <h2>TRACK_INFO</h2>
  <p>
    We have a number of tracks for all you knowledge-hungry people.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cover any level between beginner and expert, and we've taken special care to have
    content for intermediate Haskell programmers. There has never been a better time
    to learn some real-world applied Haskell skills!
  </p>

      <h3>Advanced Track</h3>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
        type specimen book.

      <h3>IHP workshop</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP web framework</a> is an
        up-and-coming web framework that has been compared to Ruby-on-Rails. It has
        been received with a lot of excitement, since it comes with highly polished tools
        and doesn't need deep technical knowledge to build useful websites very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creators of IHP, <a href="https://digitallyinduced.com/">digitally induced</a>,
        will hold tutorials that teach you how to get productive with the framework.
        We recommend that even total beginners check it out,
        as some people have learned Haskell simply through using IHP first.
