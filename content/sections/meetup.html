<div class="twocolumn"><div class="left"><h2>Last meetup</h2><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a><p class="meetup-time">Thursday 25 October, 19:00</p><p>Continuing the theme of unit testing, we’ll discuss why it’s important to observe unit test failures and how to make this experience less disturbing. I will also present the design of the library I started to work on recently in order to make unit testing in Haskell a bit less painful. We’ll take a look at how the types started simple and then gradually evolved to accommodate new requirements.</p> <p>This talk should be easily approachable even for people just starting their journey into Haskell but could also be interesting for seasoned Haskellers.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/250661375/">GHC Newcomers Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/249734259/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/248510184/">Nicolas Mattia - Interactive data exploration using Jupyter, Haskell and Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/247340310/">Getting things done in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/246552004/">BYOCP Nr. 1 - Bring Your Own Coding Problem</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/245248358/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - An overview of validity based testing</a></li></ul></div></div>
