Would you like to help the Zurich Haskell community grow?</p> <p>The General Assembly gives you the ability to get a glimpse into the Zurich Friends of Haskell and its roles. It is not a big event, but an important one. The agenda follows the statutes of the association: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8eHAK40hiH5jv79AscWtf3pyUNxx4Ls1LwkpLYK--8/edit" class="linkified">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8eHAK40hiH5jv79AscWtf3pyUNxx4Ls1LwkpLYK--8/edit</a></p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2018.<br/>2. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2019.<br/>3. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2018.<br/>4. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2018.<br/>5. We elect the board for 2019.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there :)</p> <p>Note there will be a HaskellerZ talk following the GA. That talk will be announced separately. This meetup is for the GA only.</p> <p>Note also members of the ZFoH have received an invitation via e-mail separately. It would nevertheless be good to RSVP to this event so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thanks.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/257937027/">Michal Terepeta - Implementing Immutable Vectors in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256365298/">Scala eXchange London</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256833686/">Safe programming in Industry, Testing in Haskell (Guest Lecture at the HSR)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256301621/">Beth Aitman - A practical guide to making good documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li></ul></div></div>
