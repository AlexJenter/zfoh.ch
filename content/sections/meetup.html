Safe programming in Industry (08h10-08h55)<br/>We explore the trade-offs that show up in industrial software engineering, in particular with respect to software that has a safety requirement, and discuss the technical considerations and conclusions that follow. As it happens, using Haskell is frequently one of those results, so we will also dive into examples where using Haskell and Haskell-like languages were the chosen option. Examples include work at Spam fighting at Facebook, Design of cities at ETH Zuerich, crypto currency at the Cardano Foundation, etc.</p> <p>2. Testing in Haskell (09h05-09h50)<br/>Testing, expensive and tedious as it may seem, need not be so. In this talk we explore how standard testing methods translate into Haskell. After that we go further and show how Haskell allows for much more powerful, cheaper and more effective testing.<br/>Topics include:<br/>• Unit testing<br/>• Property testing<br/>• Property combinators<br/>• Test suite combinators<br/>• Teaser: signature inference</p> <p>Location: HSR, Room 5.003<br/>(See <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/de/die-hsr/campus/" class="linkified">https://www.hsr.ch/de/die-hsr/campus/</a> for directions)</p> <p>You are welcome to attend in case one of these topics interests you.</p> <p>Please note that this will take place at the HSR in Rapperswil, and will be more in the form of a lecture than a get-together. Please also note, that the lectures will take place in the *morning*, and not in the evening.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing you there,<br/>Farhad</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256301621/">Beth Aitman - A practical guide to making good documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/250661375/">GHC Newcomers Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/249734259/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/248510184/">Nicolas Mattia - Interactive data exploration using Jupyter, Haskell and Nix</a></li></ul></div></div>
