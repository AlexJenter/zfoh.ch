In addition, web and mobile development is changing faster than many other fields of programming. That is the chance for functional programming to become established in this area, isn't it?</p> <p>In this talk, we will examine the current state of the art of functional programming for web and mobile. In the first part, I will present the results of my corresponding seminar work. It is about advantages and disadvantages, the influence, the spread and the future of functional programming in web and mobile development. Furthermore, we will also take a short look at existing functional solutions in this field (e.g. Elm). In the second part, we will discuss these findings together and talk about your own experiences on this topic.</p> <p>(Note: This talk as final presentation is also part of the seminar work.)</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260571298/">Jasper Van der Jeugt - Implementing In-memory Caches in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/259821063/">Niklas Hambüchen - hatrace: A syscall tracing library in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258850066/">Artem Chirkin - Experimenting with Constraints</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258665750/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/257937027/">Michal Terepeta - Implementing Immutable Vectors in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256365298/">Scala eXchange London</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256833686/">Safe programming in Industry, Testing in Haskell (Guest Lecture at the HSR)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256301621/">Beth Aitman - A practical guide to making good documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li></ul></div></div>
