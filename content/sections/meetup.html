Therefore we decided to hold a remote video meetup this month.</p> <p>We will have a small presentation/tutorial followed by an interactive workshop. The goal will be to write a server that serves a website and takes orders. Our inspiration for this will be <a href="https://cravecookie.com/" class="linkified">https://cravecookie.com/</a> , and we will start off with simple dumb code that gets the job done. The plan is:</p> <p>- Serve stuff with Spock<br/>- make an ugly front page<br/>- take orders and post them into a slack channel<br/>- save those same orders in a database</p> <p>So if you've ever wondered how to go from simple coding exercises to writing a useful application in Haskell, then this workshop is for you.</p> <p>Now, this will clearly be an experiment, and I'm sure we will learn some interesting things about holding meetups remotely. The way we will do it is a video meeting with Zoom, and a Slack channel to answer each other's questions in a more decentralized way.</p> <p>Basically you need to do two things:</p> <p>1. Join our ZuriHac Slack with this link: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/zurihac/shared_invite/zt-ctzx6hfb-Q6cXOV1cZT1LRwGFWgz0gA" class="linkified">https://join.slack.com/t/zurihac/shared_invite/zt-ctzx6hfb-Q6cXOV1cZT1LRwGFWgz0gA</a> , then join the #meetup﻿-﻿2﻿0﻿2﻿0﻿-﻿0﻿3 channel.<br/>2. Join the Zoom meeting here: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/748486478" class="linkified">https://zoom.us/j/748486478</a> .</p> <p>You don't need to create a Zoom account or download an app as far as I know, but please let me know if you have any questions.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there.<br/>Juri &amp; Cazim</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/268245453/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/267492326/">Marion Schleifer - Open source with Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/266267206/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - Cooperative distributed agreement</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265429171/">Roland Senn - The GHCi debugger</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265048719/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #4</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/263933519/">Martin Huschenbett - Embedding DSLs deeper into GHC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/262814143/">Mauro Bieg - pandoc: converting documents for fun and profit!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260822879/">Jonas Wälter - Functional Programming for Web and Mobile</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260571298/">Jasper Van der Jeugt - Implementing In-memory Caches in Haskell</a></li></ul></div></div>
