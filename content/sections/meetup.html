And good docs make a huge difference to usability - all of us have struggled to use something because of poor documentation(2). In particular, docs for Haskell libraries have a reputation for being pretty opaque.</p> <p>So we know that documentation is important. But writing it is kind of a pain. And so many developers don't really bother.</p> <p>The goal of this talk is to make it much less painful for you to write documentation - and possibly even enjoyable. I'll give you a practical guide to writing effective documentation, and the conceptual background you need to understand the problem space.</p> <p>We'll cover:<br/>what to write, and how to work out what you need to write<br/>tips for making your writing clear and easy-to-read<br/>making docs work for your audience (aka - when it is and isn't appropriate to talk about category theory)<br/>how to put docs together in the Haskell ecosystem, and what should go where<br/>maintenance and testing<br/>with plenty of examples of good and bad along the way.</p> <p>(1) <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-ways-developers-learn-on-their-own" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-ways-developers-learn-on-their-own</a>, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-ways-developers-teach-themselves" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-ways-developers-teach-themselves</a><br/>(2) <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work" class="linkified">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work</a></p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/250661375/">GHC Newcomers Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/249734259/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/248510184/">Nicolas Mattia - Interactive data exploration using Jupyter, Haskell and Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/247340310/">Getting things done in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/246552004/">BYOCP Nr. 1 - Bring Your Own Coding Problem</a></li></ul></div></div>
