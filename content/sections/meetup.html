But, what if you want to go further? What if you want custom syntax? Or compile to a custom core language? For the DAML project we had exactly those requirements. In this talk we'll explain how we repurpose GHC to achieve them.</p> <p>One of our main objectives is to reuse as much of GHC as possible with as few modifications as necessary. In particular, we do not want to touch the type checker since that is a complex and regularly changing part of the compiler. Consequently, changing any of GHC's ASTs is not an option. This desire heavily conflicts with the need to compile our custom syntax to corresponding constructs in our core language. This core language is basically System F plus primitives to define, create, query and archive smart contracts. The key idea to achieve this transportation without changing any of the ASTs is to desugar our custom syntax to standard Haskell constructs and recover them during the final conversion from GHC's core language to our custom core language.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/262814143/">Mauro Bieg - pandoc: converting documents for fun and profit!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260822879/">Jonas Wälter - Functional Programming for Web and Mobile</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260571298/">Jasper Van der Jeugt - Implementing In-memory Caches in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/259821063/">Niklas Hambüchen - hatrace: A syscall tracing library in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258850066/">Artem Chirkin - Experimenting with Constraints</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258665750/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/257937027/">Michal Terepeta - Implementing Immutable Vectors in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256365298/">Scala eXchange London</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256833686/">Safe programming in Industry, Testing in Haskell (Guest Lecture at the HSR)</a></li></ul></div></div>
