I also show how I can reliably reproduce rare GHC bugs with it, how to use it for testing, some of the implementation details, and interesting potential use cases.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258850066/">Artem Chirkin - Experimenting with Constraints</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258665750/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/257937027/">Michal Terepeta - Implementing Immutable Vectors in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256365298/">Scala eXchange London</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256833686/">Safe programming in Industry, Testing in Haskell (Guest Lecture at the HSR)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/256301621/">Beth Aitman - A practical guide to making good documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/255339089/">Roman Kashitsyn - Embracing the Failure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/254538726/">Simon Meier - Test-Driven Development of a Unification Algorithm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li></ul></div></div>
