You'll see how you can take advantage of GraphQL being a typed query language and you'll learn about the advantages over REST APIs. Second, you’ll learn what the architecture of the Hasura GraphQL server is and what design principles drove it. If you are a Haskeller interested in contributing to Hasura's GraphQL server, you'll learn how to do that and thereby gain experience in technologies such as GraphQL and Postgres.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Marion is a Developer Experience Engineer at Hasura working closely with the developer community and making sure they have a smooth experience with their GraphQL APIs. She is also a community organizer in Zurich (Switzerland) where she is running several meetups, such as Women Techmakers Switzerland and the GraphQL meetup. She loves bringing people together to talk about technology and to learn new things.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/266267206/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - Cooperative distributed agreement</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265429171/">Roland Senn - The GHCi debugger</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265048719/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #4</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/263933519/">Martin Huschenbett - Embedding DSLs deeper into GHC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/262814143/">Mauro Bieg - pandoc: converting documents for fun and profit!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260822879/">Jonas Wälter - Functional Programming for Web and Mobile</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/260571298/">Jasper Van der Jeugt - Implementing In-memory Caches in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/259821063/">Niklas Hambüchen - hatrace: A syscall tracing library in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/258850066/">Artem Chirkin - Experimenting with Constraints</a></li></ul></div></div>
